I. What is the App?

Keep track of what you owe people and what people owe you.

II. Story

This app is inspired by Jamie Dimon (the CEO of JPMorgan)’s practice of keeping two notebooks. One notebook is a list of what he owes people and the other is for what others owe him.

III. How it works

JDi turns Mr. Dimon’s practice of two to-do lists into one app. Users will create an user account and can start entering to-dos, the date they are due, and if it is owed to others or owed by others. The app uses Parse for its backend.

IV. Code

Splash Screen
Login Screen
Registration Screen
Parse Server
To-Do Activities and Related Code

V. Potential Troubleshooting

When importing the project for the first time into eclipse, you will need to add the appcat7 file (included in zip). To do this, right-click the project file -> property -> android -> remove the appcat7 file with the red X and add the same file back. 

Vi. Pivot

In Week 2, we decided to pivot from a social media app (Coffee Chat) to a more practical productivity app (JDi) because we felt we would learn more if we build an app from the ground up instead of using a lot of APIs and just altering the UI/UX. With JDi we have been able to learn to use a backend, login features, button functionalities, and UI/UX.
